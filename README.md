siemafilter
===========

language filter mod for world of tanks

It removes non english messages from the battle chat.

The language is identified by a python port of the algorithm developed by:
https://github.com/echen/unsupervised-language-identification

It should have a fairly good detection rate but is not trained for the typical
world of tanks spam.

This is the first beta version for testing.
