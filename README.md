siemafilter
===========

language filter mod for World Of Tanks

It removes non english messages from the battle chat.

The language is identified by a python port of the algorithm developed by:
https://github.com/echen/unsupervised-language-identification

It should have a fairly good detection rate but is not trained for the typical
world of tanks spam so there migth be false positives and some stuff going through.

This is the first beta version for testing.

Install:
download the zip and unpack into World Of Tanks main directory.
